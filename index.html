            <article>1. Wash 6 oz soy beans and soak them in 8 cups filtered water overnight, or at least 4 hours.

            <article>2. Drain the beans, combine in the blender with two cups water. If you use a soy milk maker, like I do, you will do the blending and cooking in the device.

            <article>3. Bring the mixture to a boil. Watch carefully because it will foam up quickly and you will need to adjust the burner when it does. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest about 10 minutes to cool off slightly. Line a strainer with cheese cloth and pour the mixture through, to separate the pulp from the liquid. The resulting liquid is fresh soy milk and will keep 3-5 days in the fridge. Twist the cheese cloth to extract every bit of moisture from the material. The pulp leftover from the blended beans is called "Okara". It is high in protein, calcium, and dietary fiber and is often made into a dish called unohana, which a little like fried rice, without the rice.

            <article>4. Put the soy milk back onto the stove and heat to 170 F. Add 1 tsp of nigari salt and stir (slowly) for 30 seconds, then remove from the heat. The milk will begin to curdle. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.

            <article>5. Dampen a cloth with water and use it to line a tofu mold, then place into a dish to catch draining liquid from the tofu. Ladle the tofu curds into the mold, draining as much liquid as possible before putting into the mold. Tap the mold to compress the tofu and remove air pockets. Fold the cloth over the top of the tofu, and weigh it down with something heavy. I used a can and a cast iron pot lid.

            <article>5. Once the tofu is pressed to the firmness you want, keep it in fresh water in the fridge.
